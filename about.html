            <h1>About Mardi Gras</h1>
            <p>
              The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana,
              including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated
              for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day
              before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian
              tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
              permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and
              most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
              Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
              Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls
              (some of them masquerade balls).
            </p>
            <p>
              The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as
              krewes; most follow the same parade schedule and route each year.
              The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus,
              the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus.
              Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large
              parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best
              known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades),
              the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as
              their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a
              predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally
              toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of
              colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups",
              Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the
              same parade schedule and route each year.
            </p>
            <p>
              While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on
              Bourbon Street, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City
              districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal
              Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades
              - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take
              place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the
              weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally
              concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus

              <h2>LaToya Cantrell Congratulations to the visitors</h2>

              <p>
                As Mayor of the great City of New Orleans, I invite you to visit
                our city to experience the excitement of Mardi Gras!
              </p>

              <p>
                The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the
                Feast of the Epiphany, also called Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day.
                Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big
                event.
              </p>

              <p>
                Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling
                before Mardi Gras Day. Our private Carnival clubs, called
                krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and
                toys to parade goers. Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me
                something mister!
              </p>

              <p>
                The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on
                Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club and the
                Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and
                elaborate costumes add to the fun-filled day of excitement for
                revelers of all ages.
              </p>

              <p>
                New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music
                and cuisine, is an exciting place to be at any time of the year.
                We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in
                their lifetime. Make your plans now to be a part of this great
                tradition and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les bon temps
                rouler!"
              </p>
